What are VBOs?

A Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) is a buffer in GPU memory that stores vertex data, such as:

    Positions
    Normals
    Colors
    Texture coordinates

Instead of sending vertex data to the GPU every frame, you upload it once to a VBO, and the GPU can access it directly. This reduces the overhead of repeatedly transferring data between the CPU and GPU.


What are VAOs?

A Vertex Array Object (VAO) is an OpenGL object that encapsulates the state related to vertex attribute configuration. It stores:

    Links between the vertex attributes (e.g., position, color) and the VBOs containing the corresponding data.
    Attribute pointers (e.g., how to interpret the data in the buffer).

Using a VAO makes it easy to reuse configurations, as you only need to bind the VAO instead of setting up all the attribute pointers every time.



1. What Are Model, View, and Projection Matrices?

These three matrices are essential components for transforming objects in a 3D world to the screen space of your window.
Model Matrix:

    The model matrix defines the transformation of a 3D object in the world. It handles translations, rotations, and scaling for the object.
    For example, if you want to move (translate), rotate, or scale an object, you use the model matrix to do so.

View Matrix:

    The view matrix represents the camera's position and orientation in the world. It transforms objects from world space to camera (or view) space.
    Essentially, it defines where the camera is located and where it's looking. The camera itself is treated as an object in the world, and this matrix is used to “move” the world in relation to the camera's position.

Projection Matrix:

    The projection matrix defines how the 3D scene is projected onto a 2D screen.
    It handles how objects are scaled and clipped as they move further away or closer to the camera. The two most common types of projections are:
        Perspective Projection: Objects farther from the camera appear smaller, mimicking how we perceive the world.
        Orthographic Projection: Objects retain their size, regardless of how far they are from the camera (no perspective effect).
